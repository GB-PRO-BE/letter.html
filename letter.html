<h1>Re: Eileen Dover applying to college<br></h1>

<br>
Dear Eileen,<br>
<br>
Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Faculty of Science at Université Génialissime to study<br> for your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br>
<br>
<h2>Start dates</h2> <br>
<br>
We are happy that you can start your studies with us at any time, but we prefer that you start at the<br> beginning of a semester; the start dates for each semester are as follows:<br>
<br>

<ul><li>First semester:  September 9, 2016  </li><br>
<li> Second semester: January 15, 2017<br><br>
<li>Third semester: May 2, 2017</li> <br></ul>


Please let me know if this is right for you, and if so, which start date you prefer.<br>
You can find more information about important university dates on our website.<br>
<br>
<h2>Study subjects</h2> <br>
<br>
In the Faculty of Genius Sciences, we have a great openness in research, as long as the subjects fall within<br> the field of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent and dedicated researcher, just<br> the kind of person we would like to have on our team. That said, among the ideas you submitted, the<br> ones that intrigued us the most are the following, in order of priority:<br>
<br>
<ul> <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of resveratrol (C14H12O3).</li> <br>
<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures above 30°C (86°F), when audience size<br> increases exponentially (effect from 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)</li> <br>
<li>Constructions in HTML and CSS for the representation of musical scores.</li> </ul> <br>
<br>
Can you provide us with more information on each of these topics, including the expected duration of the<br> research, the staff and other resources needed, and anything else we should know? Thank you.<br>
<br>
Please accept, Madam, the expression of my distinguished sentiments,<br>
Dr Eleanor Gaye<br>
